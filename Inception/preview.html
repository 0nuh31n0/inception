        <h1>Inception is a 2010 science fiction<br> 
            action film written and directed by <br>
            Christopher Nolan, who produced the <br>
            film with his wife, Emma Thomas. <br>
            <br>
            The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a <br>
            professional thief who steals <br>
            information by infiltrating the <br>
            subconscious, and is offered a chance <br>
            to have his criminal history erased as <br>
            payment for the implantation of <br>
            another person's idea into a target's <br>
            subconscious.
